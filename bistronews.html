		<h2><i>Low and Slow</i></h2>
			<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter </cite> describes it as<wbr><q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
			<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.<em>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</em></p>
